# How to help us as the crowd:

We are using crowdflower as the platform for our project (building a Food Truck Tracker), and will therefore ask you to do our HIT that we have
launched to the internal crowd. 
Find our HIT (which you will be invited to), titled "".
Launch the HIT, and follow the detailed step-by-step instructions provided in the HIT. The overarching task will be to help us identify food trucks
and digitize their menus (by translating them). The HIT will provide a mechanism for completing the aforementioned task.

# HIT Step by Step Instructions

The HIT is titled ”         “, simply click on the url provided and you can begin to help us create a better food truck culture.

The instructions for what we are looking for is provided in the HIT but here are some tips to make sure you have a smooth experience

Most of the time, menus simply list the items and price. However, some trucks have different and more tricky layouts for their menus.For example, a truck might have a section labeled burritos and a list of all possible fillings. For such cases, please transcribe each item individually such as: chicken burrito, carnitas burrito, etc.
	****show example menu with such features
If you see an item in a foreign language, just ignore it and move on.
Sometimes the menu has descriptions for the items, you can ignore these and just enter the name



# How to (eventually) use our application:

Once we have loaded the data that you help us collect into our web application, you will be able to use the web application to gain access to a catalog of
food trucks across University City. You can check out a working hosted prototype of this by going to https://wherethefoodtrucksat.herokuapp.com/ . Keep in
mind that this is a working prototype, so it is still very rudimentary in comparison to what the final product (packed with dynamic, crowd collected data as opposed to static strings) will be much more comprehensive.
