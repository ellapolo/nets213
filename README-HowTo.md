# How to help us as the crowd:

We are using crowdflower as the platform for our project (building a Food Truck Tracker), and will therefore ask you to do our HIT that we have
launched to the internal crowd. 
Find our HIT (which you will be invited to), titled "".
Launch the HIT, and follow the detailed step-by-step instructions provided in the HIT. The overarching task will be to help us identify food trucks
and digitize their menus (by translating them). The HIT will provide a mechanism for completing the aforementioned task.

# How to (eventually) use our application:

Once we have loaded the data that you help us collect into our web application, you will be able to use the web application to gain access to a catalog of
food trucks across University City. You can check out a working hosted prototype of this by going to https://wherethefoodtrucksat.herokuapp.com/ . Keep in
mind that this is a working prototype, so it is still very rudimentary in comparison to what the final product (packed with dynamic, crowd collected data as opposed to static strings) will be much more comprehensive.
